			<blockquote>
				<p>The Himalayan is indeed one heavy bike, and the BS6 upgrade means that the bike now is 5 kgs more than its BS4 counterparts. This is a serious bummer for off-road enthusiasts who like to do slides and jumps with the bike as this will now require extra effort as compared to the older ones.</p>
